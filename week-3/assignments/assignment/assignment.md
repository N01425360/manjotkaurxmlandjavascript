Q.4)Explain your thought process for these 2 declarations.
ans- by using DTD we can define format of XMl files according the way we want.so user can easily understand its structure.we can check validation of Xml file whether code  attributes and elements are written in right order or not.

XSD helps us to define structure and element types for xml document. we can inherit new elements from existing elements.
